This course shows the foundations about programming. 
For each session, I like implementing new pedagogical 
and technical knowledge in order to share the ideas 
about progamming logic. Since I love mathematics, I use to 
take some ideas and concepts to do examples in programming.

In the [UNAM FESAc's website](https://unam-fesac.github.io/), you will 
figure out more information.
