This course shows the programming foundations. For each session, I like implementing new pedagogical and
technical knowledge to share ideas about programming logic. Since I love mathematics, I use to take some
pictures and concepts to do examples in programming.

On the [UNAM FESAc's website](https://unam-fesac.github.io/), you will 
figure out more information.
