This course shows the Quantum Computing foundations. For each session, 
I like implementing new pedagogical and technical knowledge 
to share mathematical and physical concepts. 
On the [BU website](https://tinyurl.com/yhgalmw6), you will 
figure out more information.

This course shows the programming foundations. For each session, I like implementing new pedagogical and technical knowledge to share ideas about programming logic. Since I love mathematics, I use to take some pictures and concepts to do examples in programming.

On the [UNAM FESAc's website](https://unam-fesac.github.io/), you will
