Analysis of algorithms performance, time and space comlexity. Graph algorithms, vector and matrix algorithms, adversary arguments, optimal algorithms, adversart arguments, optimal algorithms, parallel algorithms, and current research topoics. Intense converage of NP-completeness with emphasis on recognizing NP-complete problems, proving NP-completeness and creating approximation algorithms (CS 5350).

It is anticipated that you should spend on average 3 - 6 hours of work per week beyond the classroom time to be competitive in this class.
