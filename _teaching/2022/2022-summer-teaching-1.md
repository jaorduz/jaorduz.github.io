This course shows the Quantum Computing foundations (5v93 S1 and S2, 2021 and 2022, respectively). For each session, I like implementing new pedagogical and technical knowledge to share mathematical and physical concepts. On the [BU website](https://tinyurl.com/yhgalmw6){:target="_blank"}, you will figure out more information.

Here some extra information:
