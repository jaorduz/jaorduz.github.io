5th ComHEP: Colombian Meeting on High Energy Physics	Meeting	talk-20	ComHEP	2020-11-30	Bogota, Col	https://indico.global/event/8695/book-of-abstracts.pdf	This contribution explores the Machine Learning techniques and Quantum Computing concepts and applications in High Energy Physics considering a phenomenological and theoretical view. Besides, we show the main tools to explore the Standard Model extensions, decay process and the parameter space. With this set of tools, we want to explore the bounds and define exclusion regions, those bounds might be relevant to explore in the next generation of colliders and could be tested in order to understanding of phenomena.
XXXIV RADPyC	Meeting	poster-10	Mexico	2020-07-09	Mexico City, Mex	https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wvu7ruwrr4axt45q52jnn/ptrQMLasHEPTool.pdf?rlkey=1qwkdql81mpf5t6gy3jqzy6k4&e=1&dl=0	In this poster, I share an introduction of QML, concepts and tools that could be relevant for High Energy Physics in a phenomenological view. I am interestedin implementing some algorithms coming from Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing, an ideal language of programming and frameworks to analyze orreproduce some HEP process and its features. This project is going on and I hope to report results soon.
